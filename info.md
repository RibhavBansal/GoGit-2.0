Both are one and the same. Some name the branch as main and some as master
The 'master' branch is the default branch name for any git's fresh repository.
BUT While creating new repository,
if we add a README file, one line displayed ie "This will set  main as the default branch"
But we can change default branch from main to master or vice-versa
